			Nebula Hosting is server infrastructure, simplified. The service launched as Maega Hosting in 2015 as a modern twist on traditional web & VPS hosting, Nebula Hosting delivered a custom-built user friendly wizard <i style="font-size: 0.9em">(written in PHP and designed to integrate with WHMCS)</i> to help users find the right server requirements for their project without all the complexities.

			Today, the Nebula Hosting platform has been sunset. However, Nebula Hosting lives on providing standlone, tailor made server hosting alongside my freelance development services.
